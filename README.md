# Overview

I wrote this program to learn how android development works in Java. 

I wrote a simple guessing game program that generates a random number between 0 and 20 and the user
has the opportunity to try to guess which number is. The program will give hints to the user saying
if the guess was too low or too high.

The link below is a demo video of me running the app.

# Development Environment

I used Android Studio to develop this app and the simulator that I used to run the app was the
Pixel 2.

The backend logic was written in Java.
